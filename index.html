<p>Hidden Service Setup Guides for specific hidden services are in general, really, extravagantly, dangerously bad. Let’s learn about why and how to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>About the deprecated term: I know that TPO now prefers the term <code>.onion</code> service</strong> <strong>over the older term “hidden” service. Throughout this guide I will be using</strong> <strong>Hidden Service to refer to both <code>.onion</code> and <code>.i2p</code> services.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 1:</strong> <a href="BAD/index.html">What’s wrong with them?</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/PERFUNCTORY.html">Many of them are pretty perfunctory</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/POORLYRESEARCHED.html">Most of them are poorly researched</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/RISKS.html">They’re taking the risks for granted</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/RISKSUNDERSTANDING.html">They’re taking your understanding of the risks for granted</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/CHECKWORK.html">Nobody is checking their work or updating anything</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/FROMBEHIND.html">They’re starting from behind</a></li>
<li><a href="BAD/PRIORART.html">They’re ignoring whatever good work exists</a></li>
<li><strong>Section 2:</strong> <a href="GOOD/index.html">How do we fix it?</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/DOUBLECHECK.html">If it seems easy, check it again a couple times</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/FRONTLOAD.html">Front-load your research, heavily</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/OBVIOUS.html">State the obvious</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/SPECIFY.html">Encourage specific, real-world behavior and use-cases</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/PUBLISH.html">Show your work</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/SOFTWARE.html">Don’t be afraid to use software that makes your life easier</a></li>
<li><a href="GOOD/SHARE.html">Share!</a> The Available Guides are Largely Perfunctory ============================================</li>
</ul>
<p>That is not to say that all the guides out there are totally useless, but by and large, all Hidden services Setup Guides re-iterate the same 4 steps without any further elucidation. Only a handful of exceptions exist.</p>
<p>While it is true that setting up a hidden service in the most trivial sense is simply a matter of connecting a local service to a <code>.onion</code> or <code>.i2p</code> host provided by Tor or I2P.</p>
<h2 id="the-exception-to-the-rule">The exception to the Rule:</h2>
<p>We need exactly one guide like this, and it needs to be this one: <a href="https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/">from the Tor Project</a> and it needs to have a section like <a href="https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/#step-6:-security-advice-and-more-tips">this one</a> at the end.</p>
