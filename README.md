# PLEASE Write Better Hidden Service Setup Guides

Hidden Service Setup Guides for specific hidden services are in general, really,
extravagantly, dangerously bad. Let's learn about why and how to fix it.

**About the deprecated term: I know that TPO now prefers the term `.onion` service**
**over the older term "hidden" service. Throughout this guide I will be using**
**"Hidden Service" to refer to both `.onion` and `.i2p` services.**

 * **Section 1:** [What's wrong with them?](BAD/README.md)
  - [Many of them are pretty perfunctory](BAD/PERFUNCTORY.md)
  - [Most of them are poorly researched](BAD/POORLYRESEARCHED.md)
  - [They're taking the risks for granted](BAD/RISKS.md)
  - [They're taking your understanding of the risks for granted](BAD/RISKSUNDERSTANDING.md)
  - [Nobody is checking their work or updating anything](BAD/CHECKWORK.md)
  - [They're starting from behind](BAD/FROMBEHIND.md)
  - [They're ignoring whatever good work exists](BAD/PRIORART.md)
 * **Section 2:** [How do we fix it?](GOOD/README.md)
  - [If it seems easy, check it again a couple times](GOOD/DOUBLECHECK.md)
  - [Front-load your research, heavily](GOOD/FRONTLOAD.md)
  - [State the obvious](GOOD/OBVIOUS.md)
  - [Encourage specific, real-world behavior and use-cases](GOOD/SPECIFY.md)
  - [Show your work](GOOD/PUBLISH.md)
  - [Don't be afraid to use software that makes your life easier](GOOD/SOFTWARE.md)
  - [Share!](GOOD/SHARE.md)

The Available Guides are Largely Perfunctory
============================================

That is not to say that all the guides out there are totally useless,
but by and large, all Hidden services Setup Guides re-iterate the same
4 steps without any further elucidation. Only a handful of exceptions
exist.

While it is true that setting up a hidden service in the most trivial
sense is simply a matter of connecting a local service to a `.onion` or
`.i2p` host provided by Tor or I2P.

The exception to the Rule:
--------------------------

We need exactly one guide like this, and it needs to be this one:
[from the Tor Project](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/)
and it needs to have a section like [this one](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/#step-6:-security-advice-and-more-tips)
at the end.
